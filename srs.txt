To achieve a perfect score of 5 for each trait, we need to refine the SRS to ensure complete unambiguity, maintain understandability, ensure correctness, and enhance verifiability. Below is the revised SRS with these improvements:

# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Snake Game

## 1. Problem Background
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat apples that appear randomly on the game area. The objective is to consume as many apples as possible without colliding with the borders of the game area or the snake itself. The game is implemented in Python using the pygame module, providing a simple yet engaging experience for players.

## 2. Stakeholders / Users
- **Players**: Individuals who will play the game for entertainment.
- **Developers**: Programmers responsible for implementing and maintaining the game.
- **Game Designers**: Individuals responsible for designing the game mechanics and user interface.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. **Implementation**: The game must be developed using Python and the pygame module.
2. **Game Controls**: 
   - The player must control the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
   - The snake can move in four directions: north, east, west, and south.
   - The snake must not be able to make 180-degree turns.
3. **Game Start**: 
   - The game must start when the player presses the space button.
   - Upon starting, the game must initialize with a snake consisting of a head and one body part, and a randomly placed apple.
4. **Game Area**: 
   - The game window must have a resolution of 600x600 pixels.
   - The game area must be black, the snake's head must be dark green, the body parts light green, and the apples red.
5. **Apple Mechanics**: 
   - Only one apple must be present at a time.
   - A new apple must appear randomly on the game area after the current apple is consumed, ensuring it does not appear on the snake.
6. **Snake Growth**: 
   - The snake must grow by one unit each time it eats an apple.
7. **Game End**: 
   - The game must end if the snake collides with itself or the borders of the game area.
8. **Game Options**: 
   - The game must provide options to start a new game and exit the application.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- The game must run at a consistent speed that is not too fast, ensuring smooth gameplay.
- The performance is measured by the number of apples consumed, which is recorded as the high score.

## 5. Design Constraints
- The game must be developed using Python and the pygame module.
- The game window size is fixed at 600x600 pixels.
- The game should maintain a consistent frame rate to ensure smooth gameplay.

## 6. External Interfaces
- **User Interface**: The game window displays the game area, snake, and apples. It also provides options to start a new game and exit.
- **Input Devices**: The keyboard is used for controlling the snake and starting the game.

## 7. Security Requirements
- The game should handle invalid inputs gracefully without crashing.
- The game should not allow any form of cheating or manipulation of the high score.

## 8. Use Cases for the Application

### Use Case 1: Start Game
1. **Actor**: Player
2. **Purpose**: To start a new game session.
3. **Event Flow**:
   - The player opens the game application.
   - The player presses the space button to start the game.
   - The game initializes with a snake and a randomly placed apple.
4. **Special or Exceptional Requirements**: None

### Use Case 2: Control Snake
1. **Actor**: Player
2. **Purpose**: To control the movement of the snake.
3. **Event Flow**:
   - The player uses the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
   - The snake moves in the specified direction unless it is a 180-degree turn.
4. **Special or Exceptional Requirements**: The snake cannot make 180-degree turns.

### Use Case 3: Eat Apple
1. **Actor**: Player
2. **Purpose**: To increase the snake's size and score by eating an apple.
3. **Event Flow**:
   - The snake moves over an apple.
   - The apple is consumed, and the snake grows by one unit.
   - A new apple appears randomly on the game area, not on the snake.
4. **Special or Exceptional Requirements**: None

### Use Case 4: End Game
1. **Actor**: Player
2. **Purpose**: To end the game session when the snake collides with itself or the border.
3. **Event Flow**:
   - The snake collides with itself or the border of the game area.
   - The game ends, and the player's score is displayed.
4. **Special or Exceptional Requirements**: None

### Use Case 5: Exit Game
1. **Actor**: Player
2. **Purpose**: To close the game application.
3. **Event Flow**:
   - The player selects the exit option from the game window.
   - The game application closes.
4. **Special or Exceptional Requirements**: None

## 9. Glossary of Terms
- **Snake**: The main character controlled by the player, consisting of a head and body parts.
- **Apple**: The item that the snake consumes to grow in size and increase the score.
- **Game Area**: The 600x600 pixel window where the game takes place.
- **High Score**: The maximum number of apples consumed in a single game session.

### Enhancements for Unambiguity and Verifiability
- Clearly define the color codes for the game elements (e.g., RGB values for the snake and apple colors).
- Specify the exact frame rate for consistent gameplay (e.g., 10 frames per second).
- Provide a detailed algorithm or pseudocode for apple placement to ensure it does not appear on the snake.
- Include test cases to verify each functional requirement, such as starting the game, controlling the snake, and ending the game.

Prefix:
This function is responsible for safely exiting the Snake game application. It properly terminates the pygame module and exits the application. This is typically called when the user chooses to quit the game or when the application is closing.

Imports:
import pygame
import sys

Code:
    def exit_game(self):
        """
        Safely exits the game application by terminating pygame and closing the application.
        
        This method should be called when the user wants to quit the game or when
        the application needs to be closed. It ensures that pygame resources are
        properly released before exiting.
        
        Args:
            self: The Game instance
            
        Returns:
            None
        """
        try:
            # Quit pygame to release all resources and modules
            pygame.quit()
            
            # Exit the application
            sys.exit()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error while exiting the game: {e}")
            # Ensure the application exits even if an error occurs
            sys.exit(1)

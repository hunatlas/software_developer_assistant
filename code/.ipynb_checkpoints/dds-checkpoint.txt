### Explanation:

- **Game**: Manages the overall game state, including starting, ending, and exiting the game. It also tracks the high score.
- **Snake**: Manages the snake's position, movement, and growth. It ensures the snake cannot make 180-degree turns and checks for collisions.
- **Apple**: Manages the apple's position, ensuring it appears randomly within the game area and not on the snake.
- **GameArea**: Manages the rendering of the game elements, including the background, snake, and apple, using specified colors.

The `pygame` module is imported as it is required for handling graphics and events in the game. Each class and method is designed to fulfill specific functional requirements outlined in the SRS.
